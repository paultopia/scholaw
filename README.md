stub repo for prelim work on SSRN replacement

please discuss either by filing issues, PRs on documents, or wiki pages.  If someone wants to just start throwing code up, that would be awesome too.

For those who are just seeing this here and wondering what's going on, see [this post on Medium](https://medium.com/@PaulGowder/ssrn-has-been-captured-by-the-enemy-of-open-knowledge-b3e5bca6751d#.fodiqa66y) -- it turns out that sparked a lot of interest, and many conversations are beginning about how best to create an alternative to SSRN.  

At this moment, the main paths are 1) possible institutional support, from one or a collaboration of several existing not-for-profit academic entitites, or 2) bootstrapping something, which would largely mean throwing up some code here, deploying it in the cloud, convincing people to get involved, and then scaling as appropriate and possible. Please participate in the conversation, or watch this space for more.
